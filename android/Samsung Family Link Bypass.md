# Samsung Family Link Bypass

### Exploit Description
This exploit makes use of Samsung's app known as Secure Folder. Family Link is unable to access any contents within Secure Folder, because everything is encrypted with a password. This makes it so you can easily bypass Family Link with it.

#### Compatible Phones
- Galaxy S Series, starting from the S6 up to the S10
- Galaxy Note Series, starting from the Note 8 up to the Note 10
- Galaxy Fold
- Galaxy A Series, including the A20, A50, A70, and A90
- Galaxy Tab S Series, starting from the S3

## Instructions
#### What you need:
- A compatible phone (The list is above)
- A Samsung account (Follow Samsung's instructions on how to make one before proceeding with the guide)
- Secure Folder App (Check your app drawer if you have it. On some old versions, it is available in the Play and Galaxy Store)

### Steps
:::warning
**IMPORTANT**
Make sure *not* to use the Samsung account that is linked with Family Link, as this will make it unusable.
:::
#### Setting Up Secure Folder
1. On your phone, go to the Settings app, and then select Biometrics and Security > Secure Folder. On some phones, the first menu may be “Lock Screen and Security” or just “Security.”
2. It will prompt you to log in to your Samsung account. If you haven’t already made one, make one now. Otherwise, log into your account. 
3. Wait for the device to create your Secure Folder. This process may take up to a minute. 
4. Then, select a lock screen type for your Secure Folder. Depending on your device, you can choose a pattern, a PIN, or a password, and enable your device’s built-in fingerprint biometrics as well.

#### Adding Apps To Secure Folder
1. You can add apps to your Secure Folder, ensuring the secured version of the app can’t be launched without unlocking the folder. To do this, go to your Secure Folder and press the “Add Apps” button. 
2. From here, you can either add an app already on your phone or install a new app from Google’s Play Store or Samsung’s Galaxy Store.
3. Adding an app that’s already on your phone essentially creates another copy of the app on your device with its own cache and stored files.
4.  If you duplicate a messaging app such as WhatsApp or Telegram, you can log in to a different account within your Secure Folder. These apps retain their history and cache even after you exit the Secure Folder.
5.  This also applies to web browsing. For example, if you install Chrome in the Secure Folder, you can still retain the history, logins, and bookmarks saved in the secured app, unlike Incognito Mode.
6.  If you add an app from the Galaxy Store or the Play Store, it becomes available only on your Secure Folder. It won’t create a copy in your primary list of apps. This is useful for apps you do not want to be visible on the home page or while scrolling through your drawer.
