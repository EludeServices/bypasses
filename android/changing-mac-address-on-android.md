# Change Mac Address Android

### Exploit Description
This is actually not an exploit but a built in feature of Android, forgotten by most. This developer feature allows you to get a completely new randomized MAC-address for each network you connect to. You can exploit this by forgetting a network and reconnecting to it.

## Instructions
#### What you need:
- An Android phone above Android 9
- Braincells

### Steps
1. First you need to enable Developer Mode on your phone to access the Developer Options. To do this, first tap "Software Information" in the Settings app.
2. From there, tap the "Build Number" around 8 times. This will enable Developer Options.
3. Then go to your Developer Options and search for "wifi enhanced mac randomization" or just "mac."
4. Enable this.
5. Then, go to Network Settings, forget the WiFi you would like to have a different MAC for, and reenter the password and connect to it.
