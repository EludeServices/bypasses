# Samsung Family Link Downtime Bypass

### Exploit Description
This will only work on Samsung phones. We're not sure which models, however any models that posess the Assistant Menu will work.

The way this exploit works is by using Assistant Menu. Assistant Menu is a sort of overlay that is present at all times. A small transparent button. When Downtime locks your phone, you can use Assistant Menu to access the Alarmy app, which has an exploit that allows you to use its Webview Component to access other websites.

From Alarmy, you can also access Secure Folder. Alarm apps aren't able to be disabled because of the way Family Link works. Alarmy also has something that makes this all possible, the news section. 


## Instructions
#### What you need:
- A Samsung Phone
- Braincells

### Steps
#### Enable Assistant Menu
1. Open the Settings App
2. Search Assisant Menu
3. It should be in Accessibility. Enable it.

#### Install Alarmy
Although Alarmy is an alarm app, there is a backdoor in it that allows you to access the internet through the use of its WebView in the News Articles. Open play store, and search for the app. It should look like an outline of a clock on a white background.

:::warning
Note that your parent can see that you used Alarmy. Try not to use this method too much or they will get suspicious

#### The Bypass
1. When your phone locks due to Downtime, click on the Assistant Menu. It should look like a transparent circle thing.
2. From there, click on Home. It should take you to the apps screen. If it doesn't for some reason or takes you back to the locked screen, just try it again.
3. If Home absolutely does not do anything, try using Recent Apps. Sometimes that works as well.
4. Navigate your way to Alarmy. Since it is an admin app, Family Link cannot lock it. You should be able to click on it and open it. You can also use Secure Folder, detailed [here](/5Al7HlrjSh-K1G9L_vjQDA).
5. Once you're in Alarmy, there will be 5 panels at the bottom of your screen. Click on the 4th one that looks like a newspaper. 
6. From there, scroll all the way down, and you'll see a News section. 
7. Click on it, and it should take you to a page with a bunch of news articles. 
8. Once you're there, SPECIFICALLY find the news station CNBC. Click on it's news article and it will take you to the article. 
9. From there, scroll all the way down, where you'll see social media logos. Click on youtube.
10. Once it takes you there, click on a video, and go to write a comment. You can type a URL there, such as https://google.com
11. Once you post the comment, you will be able to click on it and explore the web. You can also use
