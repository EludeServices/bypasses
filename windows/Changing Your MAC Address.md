# Changing Your MAC Address

### Exploit Description
This is less of an exploit than it is a simple tool to change you MAC. This does, however require the use of an admin account. If you do not possess admin, please have a look at our guide [Getting Admin On Windows](/bQkfmh41TxqFQjCAVKAx5w).

The general tool we use for this purpose is known as Technitium MAC Address Changer, or TMAC. It is extremely useful, being able to disable network adapters, randomize MAC addresses, and restore the original device MAC. The following download links are **not** affiliated, mind you, we simply enjoy using TMAC.

4. On the Network Connections list, look for your connection. If you are using Wi-Fi, click on Wi-Fi. If you are using Ethernet, click on Ethernet.
