# Bypassing File Blocks

### Exploit Description
For the exe files, there are multiple ways to bypass file blocks. The easiest ways are renaming the exe extension to a .scr or .pif and converting it to an MSI file. The second way is to make an SFX archive with WinRar and merge an image to the exe file (search up how to do this). Then zip it and run it on your PC without extracting it and it should run with no problems. Bat files should be renamed to .cmd files instead.
