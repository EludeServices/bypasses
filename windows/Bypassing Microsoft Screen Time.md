# Bypassing Microsoft Screen Time

### Exploit Description
This exploit has been around for many ages and is still around today. The actual "exploit" part requires admin priveleges to remove it, however there is a way to bypass it without admin. If you, by chance do need admin please acquire it at any of these three guides: 
- [Getting Admin On Windows (USB Method)](/43BERB8RRKi4-uaD6Iacjw)
- [Getting Admin On Windows (Recovery Method)](/bfV9RdAFSP6D4xr5C7tmwA)
-  [Getting Admin on Windows V2](/TgpDiBXZR3-n1SBlHpz7Gg).

The USB Method is the most reliable as of current and that is what we recommend. Now, on to the exploit!
## Instructions
#### What you need:
- Your computer with you.
- *Preferably* admin priveleges, but not required
- Common sense
- Braincells
- Being able to read and write
- I could go on and on about the shit most of you don't have...

### Steps
#### With Admin Priveleges
1. First, go to your search bar in Windows.
2. Type `msconfig` and hit Enter. This will open the System Configuration and allow you to access the Parental Control service integrated with Windows.
3. Press the "Services" tab on the top. This is where we will find Parental Controls.
4. Press "P". Each time you press it, it will go to the next service that starts with P. Keep pressing it until you eventaully arrive at "Parental Controls."
5. Uncheck it and press Apply. Then press OK.
6. It may prompt you to restart. Click yes.
7. Profit!

#### Without Admin Privileges
No steps to this one. Once you get the warning that you are reaching your screen time limit, force a shutdown. When you reboot your computer, the time limit should be refreshed.
